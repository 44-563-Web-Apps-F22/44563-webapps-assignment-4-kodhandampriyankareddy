    <h2>Priyanka Kodhandam</h2>
<h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  <p>(furiously)</p>    False one, begone—I spurn thee,
To thy new lover turn thee!Thy perfidy all men shall know,
<h4>ALINE.</h4>  <p>(wildly)</p>       I could not help it!
<h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  <p>(calling off)</p>        Come one, come all!
<h4><div>DR. D.</div></h4>             We could not help it!
<h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  <p>(calling off) </p>       Obey my call!
<h4>ALINE.</h4> <p>(wildly)   </p>     I could not help it!
<h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  <p>(calling off)  </p>      Come hither, run!
<h4><div>DR. D.</div></h4>              We could not help it!
<h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  <p>(calling off)  </p>      Come, every one!

<p>(Enter all the characters except Lady Sangazure and Mr. Wells)</p>

             <div class="chorus"> CHORUS</div>  

Oh, what is the matter, and what is the clatter?
He's glowering at her, and threatens a blow!
Oh, why does he batter the girl he did flatter?
And why does the latter recoil from him so?
<h4><div>DR. D.</div></h4> <p>(coming forward)</p>  Hold!  Be just.  This poor child
  drank the philtre at your instance.  She hurried off to meet
  you—but, most unhappily, she met me instead.  As you had
  administered the potion to both of us, the result was inevitable.
  But fear nothing from me—I will be no man's rival.  I shall quit
  the country at once—and bury my sorrow in the congenial gloom of
  a Colonial Bishopric.<br>
  <h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  My excellent old friend!  <p>(Taking his hand—then
  turning to Mr. Wells, who has entered with Lady Sangazure.) </p> Oh,
  Mr.Wells, what, what is to be done?<br>
  <h4><span>WELLS</span></h4>  I do not know—and yet—there is one means by which
  this spell may be removed.<br>
  <h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4> Name it—oh, name it!<br>
  <h4><span>WELLS</span></h4>  Or you or I must yield up his life to Ahrimanes.  I
  would rather it were you.  I should have no hesitation in
  sacrificing my own life to spare yours, but we take stock next
  week, and it would not be fair on the Co.<br>
  <h4><mark>ALEXIS</mark></h4>  True.  Well, I am ready!<br>
  <h4>ALINE</h4>   No, no—Alexis—it must not be!  Mr. Wells, if he
  must die that all may be restored to their old loves, what is to
  become of me?  I should be left out in the cold, with no love to
  be restored to!<br>
  <h4><span> WELLS</span></h4>  True—I did not think of that. <p> (To the others)</p>  My
  friends, I appeal to you, and I will leave the decision in your
  hands.<br>
